# perovskites-oct-distortions
Collection of python functions useful to manipulate the structures of hybrid organic/inorganic perovskites.
Main directory contains:
- `rotations.py` : functions to apply random rotations to the organic molecules occupiying the `A` site in your perovskite supercell. Useful to break symmetries, avoid the polar parallel arrangement (if your cation has a dipole moment, e.g. formamidinium)
- folder `octahedral_distortions`: hosts the file `oct_distortions.py`. This contains the function `get_tilting_angles()`, which calculates the average of the `B-X-B` angles in your structure. Values close to 180ยบ indicate small tilting of the octahedra while angles deviating from 180ยบ point towards significant tilting.
