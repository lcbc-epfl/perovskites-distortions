# oct-distortions
Collection of python functions to calculate octahedral distortions in perovskites.
Outline:
- `oct_distortions.py` contains the function `get_tilting_angles`, which calculates the average of the Pb-I-Pb angles in your structure. Values close to 180ยบ indicate small tilting while angles deviating from 180ยบ point towards significant tilting of the octahedra.
